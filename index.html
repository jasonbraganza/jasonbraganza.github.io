<p>A previously undetected piece of malware found on almost 30,000 Macs worldwide is generating intrigue in security circles, which are still trying to understand precisely what it does and what purpose its self-destruct capability serves.</p>
<p>Once an hour, infected Macs check a control server to see if there are any new commands the malware should run or binaries to execute. So far, however, researchers have yet to observe delivery of any payload on any of the infected 30,000 machines, leaving the malware’s ultimate goal unknown. The lack of a final payload suggests that the malware may spring into action once an unknown condition is met.</p>
<p>Also curious, the malware comes with a mechanism to completely remove itself, a capability that’s typically reserved for high-stealth operations. So far, though, there are no signs the self-destruct feature has been used, raising the question why the mechanism exists.</p><p>Read 10 remaining paragraphs | Comments</p>

♦<p>Enlarge (credit: Bing Guan | Bloomberg | Getty Images)</p>  
<p>Across the United States, the coronavirus is in retreat. The pandemic is still raging, mind you, with more than 70,000 new cases still reported each day. But since the post-holiday peak in mid-January, the seven-day average of new cases has fallen by nearly 64 percent. Hospitalizations have plunged too. And with vaccinations accelerating, there is a glimmer of hope that this downward trend might be the start of COVID’s long slide toward containment, at least in the US and other wealthy countries that are hogging the shots.</p>
<p>But retreat does not always mean defeat. And the emergence of several worrisome new coronavirus variants with new tricks for spreading faster or evading immune responses presents another possibility: that the current reprieve will only be temporary. Public health experts are urging governments to prepare for a possible new wave of infections driven by variants like B.1.1.7, which has already been identified in more than 1,200 US cases and in nearly every state, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Prevention and Control.</p>
<p>That’s more than double the number reported two weeks earlier. But the real number is likely far higher. How much higher? No one knows. That’s because the only way to tell which version of the coronavirus is causing an infection is to sequence its genome. In this country, that should be easy enough—the US is a sequencing superpower. It has dozens of academic institutions and massive commercial labs with the capacity to crank out genomes at a rapid clip. But the federal government’s response through much of the pandemic didn’t include a plan to mobilize America’s DNA-mappers into a coordinated coronavirus-monitoring corps. SARS-CoV-2 surveillance, well, sucked.</p><p>Read 24 remaining paragraphs | Comments</p>

  TLDR



<ul><li>Security updates are very important</li><li>Stats tell us they&#8217;re not being applied by all users </li><li>Apply updates right now!</li><li>Don&#8217;t run an EOL version of Linux Mint</li></ul>



Security updates



<p>Updating is important</p>



<p>Security updates patch vulnerabilities in your computer. They protect you from local attacks (people with physical access to your computer and people who have an account on it) but also remote ones (attackers targeting your computer through your Internet connection).</p>



<p>Other than directed attacks security updates also protect you from malicious software. When you ask your computer to execute external content (software you downloaded, email attachments, a link you click or even just a webpage you visit in your Web browser) you also take the risk to open a door into your computer and invite attackers in.</p>



<p>When a vulnerability is found developers fix it as soon as possible and distributions ship it as an update so you can apply it in a timely fashion. These vulnerabilities then become public and known by potential attackers. This means an outdated system isn&#8217;t just vulnerable, it is known to be vulnerable.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s have a look at the list of known vulnerabilities in Firefox:</p>



<p>www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/known-vulnerabilities/firefox</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re not running the latest version, check which version of Firefox you&#8217;re using and count the number of critical (red) patches you&#8217;re missing. </p>



<p>Updating is easy</p>



<p>Linux Mint comes with one of the best update managers available. It&#8217;s very easy to use, it&#8217;s configurable and it shows a lot of information.</p>



♦



<p>It handles security updates for all your software. All you need to do is use it.</p>



<p>Updating is safe</p>



<p>Linux Mint ships with Timeshift to provide integrated system snapshots. With a click of a button you can revert your computer to your previous snapshot and negate the effect of any potential regression.</p>



♦



<p>Thanks to Timeshift you can configure your computer to perform automated snapshots and thus safely configure your Update Manager also to perform automated updates.</p>



<p>After it was introduced in Linux Mint 18.3, Timeshift was backported to previous Linux Mint releases. It&#8217;s available in all modern versions of Linux Mint, including EOL ones.</p>



Statistics



<p>Statistics are not precise but they do tell us something </p>



<p>Before I give statistics, take the numbers in this blog post with a pinch of salt.</p>



<p>We can&#8217;t measure anything with precision because there&#8217;s nothing in your computer which sends data to us and we don&#8217;t configure Linux Mint in a way that even allows us to count how many users we have. In other words, there is nothing in Linux Mint that is common to all users and that we could rely on to establish statistics.</p>



<p>That being said,  we do have a few metrics we can measure. They give us stats which only tell one particular aspect of the story and they are unreliable and imprecise but do tell us something nonetheless. </p>



<p>About 30% of users apply updates in less than a week</p>



<p>After we updated Firefox 85.0 we asked Yahoo to give us a breakdown of the Linux Mint traffic per user agent. These stats only covered users which use Yahoo of course but they did show us how fast the update was applied.</p>



<p>We were able to observe the fact that only 30% of users updated their web browser in less than a week.</p>



<p>These statistics also show us users of recent Linux Mint releases which do not apply updates at all. For instance, a part of that traffic uses Firefox 77 (the version which shipped with Linux Mint 20).</p>



<p>Between 5% and 30% of users run Linux Mint 17.x</p>



<p>These stats come from two distinct sources, both highly unreliable.. as you can see there&#8217;s quite a gap between 5 and 30, but they both tell us the same story.</p>



<p>0% of users should run Linux Mint 17.x! Anything above is not good, whether it&#8217;s 5% or 30%.</p>



<p>Linux Mint 17.x reached EOL (End-Of-Life) in April 2019. In other words it stopped receiving security updates for almost 2 years now!</p>



<p>The 5% figure comes from your default browser start page. The longer you use Linux Mint after you installed it the more likely you are to have changed your first page, so we can reasonably assume the number is lower than reality.</p>



<p>The 30% figure comes from our APT repositories. It&#8217;s the traffic percentage we get from Linux Mint 17.x. It&#8217;s unreliable because APT got better at performing less HTTP requests for the same queries and we lowered the default cache update frequency in modern releases. It&#8217;s unreliable also because we&#8217;ve started and became better release after release at recommending the use of local mirrors, so there is naturally a higher proportion of users not using mirrors in older releases. We can reasonably assume the number is higher than reality.</p>



<p>Again, it really doesn&#8217;t matter to us if the real number is 10% or 15%. It needs to be 0%. We have mechanisms in place to tell users when a new release becomes available now, but we didn&#8217;t have them at the time of Linux Mint 17.x.</p>



Apply updates right now!



<p>Check your version of Linux Mint</p>



<p>Open a terminal and type:</p>



<pre><code>lsb_release -r</code></pre>



<p>Install timeshift</p>



<p>If your version of Linux Mint is 18.3 or higher, Timeshift is already installed. Otherwise, type the following commands in your terminal to install it:</p>



<pre><code>apt update
apt install timeshift</code></pre>



<p>Create a system snapshot</p>



<p>Run Timeshift and configure it it it&#8217;s the first time you run it (select the default options if you&#8217;re not sure).</p>



<p>Press the &#8220;Create&#8221; button to perform a system snapshot.</p>



<p>If anything goes wrong you&#8217;ll be able to come back thanks to this snapshot.</p>



<p>Apply all updates</p>



<p>Run the Update Manager.</p>



<p>Press the &#8220;Refresh&#8221; button to find available updates.</p>



<p>If a new version of the Update Manager itself is available, you will need to apply it first.</p>



<p>Press &#8220;Install Updates&#8221; to update your computer.</p>



<p>Automate snapshots and updates</p>



<p>Updates are indicated by a shield icon in your system tray. Unlike other operating systems which rely on frustration and which annoy you at the worst possible time until you perform updates, Linux Mint gives you a visual indication that updates are available but it&#8217;s up to you to decide when to apply them.</p>



♦



<p>This setup is empowering and comfortable but it does rely on you to eventually apply the updates. We&#8217;ll need to consider a frustration mechanism if the system is neglected for months but we&#8217;ll touch on that in the next blog post.</p>



<p>If you don&#8217;t apply updates regularly then you should consider automating the process.</p>



<p>In the Timeshift configuration screen you can automate system snapshots.</p>



♦



<p>Likewise, in the Update Manager configuration screen you can automate the updates.</p>



♦



<p>Do this and you no longer need to worry about it.</p>



Firefox ESR in Linux Mint 17.x



<p>If you are still using Linux Mint 17.x you need to backup your data and reinstall a modern version ASAP.</p>



<p>Because Linux Mint 17.x has reached EOL and hasn&#8217;t received any updates for almost 2 years, we decided to send an emergency update to upgrade your Firefox web browser from version 66.0 to version 78 ESR.</p>



<p>Because it&#8217;s ESR, this update will create a new Firefox profile for you. If you want to get back to your previous profile, close Firefox, open a terminal and type:</p>



<pre><code>firefox -ProfileManager</code></pre>



<p>Select the &#8220;default&#8221; profile.</p>



<p>Do upgrade Firefox right now as it is a very important part of your system, but please be aware that it is not enough. You will need to reinstall Linux Mint as soon as possible. You cannot run something that has unpatched known vulnerabilities for years, it&#8217;s too risky. Think of all these banks and establishments which got hit because they were still running Windows XP. We don&#8217;t want this to be you. After 5 years of support, Linux Mint 17.x is simply not supported anymore. You need to move away from it.</p>



<p>The latest version of Linux Mint is 20.1. It is supported until April 2025.</p>



Thank you



<p>If you know users of Linux Mint which do not read the blog, please spread the word for us, especially if their system is not up to date or if they run an old release. We&#8217;ve no other way of reaching them than via communication here or software updates.</p>



<p>Thank you all for your attention and consideration.</p>

♦<p>Enlarge / This green circle (we added the background) is the Android 12 logo, we guess.  </p>  
<p>The first Android 12 developer preview hit the streets Thursday, and we've played with it for a day. There's not a lot to see in this release—at least not at first. Most of the interesting bits are hidden, and the developer community is slowly enabling them. Many changes are half-finished alpha tweaks that will look different in the final release; after all, Google says these releases are for "testing and feedback."</p>
<p>This first release of Android 12 is meant to get some APIs and other changes in front of people for feedback, but it's also designed to not spill the beans too much on what the final build of Android 12 will look like. With that in mind, many of the features in an earlier Android 12 leak seem right on the money. This public release is a sanitized build with a lot of stuff turned off, but the more we flip on hidden flags and catch hints in the documentation, the more this build looks like a solid halfway point between Android 11 and those leaked Android 12 screenshots.</p>

♦<p>Enlarge / Long rumored, finally confirmed. (credit: Blizzard)</p>  
<p>Blizzard's latest BlizzCon event sees the longtime PC game maker at perhaps its most beleaguered yet. Game delays, notable departures, botched remakes, smartphone-gaming backlash, and an anti-protester reputation have weighed down what was once a sterling RTS/RPG reputation. That led us to wonder: can today's streaming-only BlizzCon showcase of games and plans show that the company's recent hires and behind-the-scenes reshuffling are paying off?</p>
<p>In at least one respect, the outlook is optimistic, thanks to an impressive reveal of Diablo II: Resurrected. This long-rumored remake includes everything from both the base 2000 game and its 2001 expansion, Lord of Destruction. At first glimpse, this top-to-bottom remake seems to get everything right that WarCraft III: Reforged got so very, very wrong—and we won't have to wait very long to come up with our own impressions. Sign-ups for D2:R's technical alpha are now live ahead of the game's launch on PC and consoles "in 2021."</p>
The right balance between preservation and polish?

<p>The Earth's magnetic field helps protect life from energetic particles that would otherwise arrive from space. Mars now lacks a strong magnetic field, and the conditions on its surface are considered so damaging to life that any microbes that might inhabit the planet are thought to be safely beneath the surface. On Earth, the magnetic field ensures that life can flourish on the surface.</p>
<p>Except that's not always true. The Earth's magnetic field varies, with the poles moving and sometimes swapping places and the field sometimes weakening or effectively vanishing. Yet a look at these events has revealed nothing especially interesting—no obvious connections to extinctions, no major ecological upsets.</p>
<p>A paper published yesterday in Science provides an impressively precise dating for a past magnetic field flip by using rings of trees that have been dead for tens of thousands of years. And it shows the flip was associated with changes in climate. But the paper then goes on to attempt to tie the flip to everything from a minor extinction event to the explosion of cave art by our ancestors. In the end, the work is a mix of solid science, provocative hypothesizing, and unconstrained speculation.</p><p>Read 20 remaining paragraphs | Comments</p>

♦<p>Enlarge </p>  
<p>Bitcoin's price soared past $56,000 on Friday, pushing the combined value of all bitcoins past the $1 trillion mark—at least in theory. That's more than the market capitalization of Facebook, though Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft are worth more. Bitcoin's value has almost doubled from $29,000 since the start of the year.</p>
<p>I say "in theory" because not all bitcoins are actually available for use. Each bitcoin (or fraction of a bitcoin) is secured by one or more cryptographic signatures. To transfer a bitcoin, you need to know its corresponding private key. And some of those keys have been lost—and it's impossible to know how many.</p>
<p>For example, a British man says he threw away a hard drive in 2013 that contained the keys to 7,500 bitcoins—worth around $400 million at today's price. He sought permission to excavate the dump containing the hard drive, but the request was denied.</p><p>Read 6 remaining paragraphs | Comments</p>

<p>In a bit of good news, Pfizer and BioNTech announced today that their highly effective COVID-19 vaccine does not require ultra-cold storage conditions after all and can be kept stable at standard freezer temperatures for two weeks.</p>
<p>The companies have submitted data to the US Food and Drug Administration demonstrating the warmer stability in a bid for regulatory approval to relax storage requirements and labeling for the vaccine.</p>
<p>If the FDA greenlights the change, the warmer storage conditions could dramatically ease vaccine distribution, allowing doses to be sent to non-specialized vaccine administration sites. The change would also make it much easier to distribute the vaccine to low-income countries.</p><p>Read 5 remaining paragraphs | Comments</p>

<p>NASA on Friday released new images of its Perseverance spacecraft approaching the surface of Mars and safely settling upon the red planet.</p>
<p>The new photos included an arresting image of the Jeep-sized rover nearing Mars, seemingly dangling from the sky crane that was lowering it to the surface about 7 meters below. This image was pulled from footage of the rover's landing, captured by on-board cameras. A complete video of the dramatic landing sequence may be released as early as Monday after NASA engineers receive more data from Mars.</p>

<p>"It is exhilarating. It is absolutely exhilarating," said Adam Steltzner, the chief engineer for the Perseverance mission, which successfully landed on Mars on Thursday.

<p>Comcast is delaying a plan to enforce its 1.2TB data cap and overage fees in the Northeast US until 2022 after pressure from customers and lawmakers in multiple states.</p>
<p>"[W]e are delaying implementation of our new data plan in our Northeast markets until 2022," Comcast said in an announcement yesterday. "We recognize that our data plan was new for our customers in the Northeast, and while only a very small percentage of customers need additional data, we are providing them with more time to become familiar with the new plan."</p>
<p>Comcast has enforced the data cap in 27 of the 39 states in which it operates since 2016, but not in the Northeast states where Comcast faces competition from Verizon's un-capped FiOS fiber-to-the-home service. In November 2020, Comcast announced it would bring the cap to the other 12 states and the District of Columbia starting in January 2021. But with yesterday's announcement, no one in those 12 states and DC will be charged overage fees by Comcast in all of 2021.</p><p>Read 11 remaining paragraphs | Comments</p>

<p>The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom has ruled that Uber drivers are legally workers, not self-employed contractors as Uber has argued in courts around the world. The ruling means that drivers in Britain and Northern Ireland are eligible for additional benefits and protections, including a minimum wage.</p>
<p>Uber claims that it merely acts as a technology provider and broker between independent drivers and their customers—much as eBay facilitates sales between buyers and sellers. In Uber's view, this means that it doesn't owe its drivers benefits like unemployment insurance, doesn't need to reimburse drivers for their costs, and isn't bound by minimum wage and overtime rules. Uber emphasizes that its drivers are free to decide when, where, and how much they work.</p>
<p>But critics point out that Uber exerts a lot more control over its drivers—and over the driver-passenger relationship—than a conventional platform like eBay or Airbnb. Uber sets fares, collects payments from customers, deducts its own fee, and remits the remainder to the driver. It requires drivers to accept a large majority of the rides they are offered. It handles customer complaints and kicks drivers off the platform if their average rating falls too low.</p><p>Read 11 remaining paragraphs | Comments</p>

<p>Apple's bitter legal dispute with Epic Games over the distribution of Fortnite on iOS has now managed to rope in Valve. Apple has subpoenaed the Steam maker for a wide range of PC game sales data it says is crucial to its case.

<p>The prospect of Web users being tracked by the sites they visit has prompted several countermeasures over the years, including using Privacy Badger or an alternate anti-tracking extension, enabling private or incognito browsing sessions, or clearing cookies. Now, websites have a new way to defeat all three.</p>
<p>The technique leverages the use of favicons, the tiny icons that websites display in users’ browser tabs and bookmark lists. Researchers from the University of Illinois, Chicago said in a new paper that most browsers cache the images in a location that’s separate from the ones used to store site data, browsing history, and cookies. Websites can abuse this arrangement by loading a series of favicons on visitors’ browsers that uniquely identify them over an extended period of time.</p>
Powerful tracking vector
<p>“Overall, while favicons have long been considered a simple decorative resource supported by browsers to facilitate websites’ branding, our research demonstrates that they introduce a powerful tracking vector that poses a significant privacy threat to users,” the researchers wrote.

♦<p>Enlarge / That's quite the game-announcement leak there, Blizzard. (credit: Blizzard)</p>  
<p>Ahead of this weekend's BlizzCon game-announcement frenzy, two of Blizzard's secrets have sneaked out in the form of a leak. Both revolve around World of Warcraft: one for the latest Shadowlands expansion, and another for the World of Warcraft Classic server option.</p>
<p>In the latter case, 2007's hugely popular WoW expansion pack, The Burning Crusade, will be bolted onto the WoW Classic option inside the Blizzard Launcher starting sometime in "2021." The news comes from an apparent leak of official BlizzCon press release materials, all formatted with official images and descriptions of what's to come, as found on Blizzard's official servers by users at Reddit's WoW community.</p>
<p>As with 2019's official WoW vanilla launch, The Burning Crusade will return without any new or special features on top of what originally came with the game. You may recall that this expansion pack included a trickle of content drops while Blizzard maintained it before selling Wrath of the Lich King in 2008. Meanwhile, Blizzard's leaked document claims that the original version's update cadence will return: "Content from the original game will roll out in phases, at a cadence paced for the WoW Classic community. Prepare for the opening of the Black Temple, gear up to confront the gods of Zul'Aman, and gather your allies to face the fury of the Sunwell."</p><p>Read 3 remaining paragraphs | Comments</p>

<p>The hackers behind one of the worst breaches in US history read and downloaded some Microsoft source code, but there’s no evidence they were able to access production servers or customer data, Microsoft said on Thursday. The software maker also said it found no evidence the hackers used the Microsoft compromise to attack customers.</p>
<p>Microsoft released those findings after completing an investigation begun in December, after learning its network had been compromised. The breach was part of a wide-ranging hack that compromised the distribution system for the widely used Orion network-management software from SolarWinds and pushed out malicious updates to Microsoft and roughly 18,000 other customers.</p>
<p>The hackers then used the updates to compromise nine federal agencies and about 100 private-sector companies, the White House said on Wednesday. The federal government has said that the hackers were likely backed by the Kremlin.</p><p>Read 7 remaining paragraphs | Comments</p>

<p>In their first press conference following Perseverance's successful landing on Mars, NASA and JPL scientists revealed some information on where the rover landed and what to expect for the next several days and weeks as it begins its mission in earnest.</p>
Pics or it didn’t happen
<p>One of the first orders of business is getting some of the images, audio, and video taken during the landing back to Earth. For now, doing so requires using a low-gain antenna to transmit data to some of the hardware in orbit around Mars. Jennifer Trosper, the deputy project manager for the rover, said that the Mars Odyssey orbiter should pass overhead briefly within the next few hours, followed by the Mars Trace Gas orbiter, which will have a longer overflight and grab larger amounts of data. Matt Wallace, another deputy project manager, said that should be enough to allow NASA to release video of the landing on Monday.</p>
<p>Longterm, however, communications will rely on a high-gain antenna that will allow direct communications with Earth. That will require pointing, which means understanding the rover's current orientation on Mars' surface, which the team has inferred from the shadows cast in the first images sent down. Incidentally, those were taken with transparent lens caps on the Perseverance's navigation cameras, so we can expect better images once those are removed.</p><p>Read 12 remaining paragraphs | Comments</p>

<p>Robinhood's move to temporarily limit purchases of GameStop and other highly volatile stocks in late January was the overwhelming focus of today's House Committee on Financial Services hearing.</p>
<p>At the hearing, Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev said that extreme stock volatility that led to Robinhood's restriction was a "five sigma" event with a "1 in 3.5 million" chance of happening. That made the situation practically impossible for the company to plan for, Tenev said. "In the context of tens of thousands of days in the history of US stock market, a 1 in 3.5 million event is basically unmodelable."</p>
<p>As we've covered previously, the high volatility of GameStop and other so-called "meme stocks" last month meant Robinhood was suddenly forced to provide much more collateral to the stock clearing houses that actually process its trades. Tenev said Thursday that these collateral obligations increased tenfold between January 25 and January 28, as GameStop rose from $76 a share to over $347, then back down to $193.</p><p>Read 20 remaining paragraphs | Comments</p>

          I'm very sorry, but this is as far off-road as I was able to take the Land Rover Defender during our time with the SUV.                      [credit:
                        Jonathan Gitlin                        ]
                  </p>
        
      </li>
      </ul><p>I wasn't expecting to be quite as charmed as I was by the Land Rover Defender. We first saw the new Defender at 2019's Frankfurt auto show, where it proved to be a hit by marrying rugged looks and off-road skills with a healthy helping of tech. Even though I fell for its looks, I was trepidatious about spending a week with the vehicle, having failed to gel with most Land Rovers in the past. As I found out, those fears were mostly misplaced, as the Defender was not at all agricultural in behavior, unlike its 20th-century forerunners.</p>
<p>But before we go any further, an apology of sorts—or at least an explanation. Last September, Land Rover held a media first-drive event for the SUV, where journalists got to spend a couple days driving up and down Mount Equinox in the Taconics. Alas, Ars couldn't attend because of scheduling conflicts—instead, we used that time to test a couple of electric vehicles. So although the Defender is built to go off-road, the best I managed during my week with it was some radical parking, as seen in the gallery above.</p>
<p>Therefore, I don't know how well it fords water up to 35.4 inches (900mm) deep. I don't know how well it approaches breaks-over or departs from obstacles (at angles of 38˚, 28˚, and 40˚, respectively). I can't really tell you how good the permanent four-wheel-drive system—with a twin-speed transfer case and optional locking center and rear differentials—works on rough ground. I can't opine on how well the various software systems (Terrain Response 2, All Terrain Progress Control, and Hill Descent Control) manage the task of keeping you right-side up and moving in the intended direction. Which makes this review somewhat lacking, as that stuff is basically the Defender's raison d'être. Mea culpa.</p><p>Read 10 remaining paragraphs | Comments</p>

<p>A group of business organizations led by the US Chamber of Commerce is suing the state of Maryland, seeking to block the implementation of the state's brand-new, first-of-its-kind tax on digital-advertising revenue.</p>
<p>Maryland's tax bill is "deeply flawed" and "illegal in myriad ways," the suit (PDF) alleges, claiming that act will "harm Marylanders and small businesses and reduce the overall quality of Internet content." </p>
<p>"This is a case of legislative overreach, punishing an industry that supports over one hundred thousand jobs in Maryland and contributes tens of billions of dollars to its economy each year," the Internet Association, one of the plaintiffs, said in a statement about the suit. "Internet services and companies are proud to play a role in creating opportunities for Maryland’s small businesses and citizens."</p><p>Read 10 remaining paragraphs | Comments</p>
